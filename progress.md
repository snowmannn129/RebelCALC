# RebelCALC Development Progress

This document tracks the development progress of RebelCALC, the advanced computational engine for RebelSUITE.

## Current Status

RebelCALC is currently in Phase 1 of development, with the basic project structure and class implementations in place. The foundation for all major components has been established, and initial documentation has been created.

## Completed Tasks

### Project Setup
- [x] Created basic directory structure
- [x] Set up CMake build system
- [x] Created README.md with project overview
- [x] Created .gitignore file
- [x] Created development roadmap
- [x] Created build scripts for Windows and Unix-like systems
- [x] Created scripts to download and build dependencies (Lua, GoogleTest)
- [x] Created test runner scripts

### Core Components
- [x] Implemented Calculator class structure
- [x] Implemented SymbolicEngine class structure
- [x] Implemented NumericSolver class structure
- [x] Implemented LuaEngine class structure
- [x] Implemented TerminalUI class structure

### Testing
- [x] Set up testing framework
- [x] Created basic tests for Calculator
- [x] Created basic tests for SymbolicEngine
- [x] Created basic tests for NumericSolver
- [x] Created basic tests for LuaEngine

### Documentation
- [x] Created user guide
- [x] Created integration guide
- [x] Created development roadmap
- [x] Created progress tracker

### Scripting
- [x] Created initialization script (init.lua)
- [x] Created utility functions script (utils.lua)
- [x] Created example scripts

## In Progress

### Core Functionality
- [ ] Implementing basic arithmetic operations
- [ ] Implementing variable management
- [ ] Implementing command-line interface

### Symbolic Mathematics
- [ ] Implementing expression parsing and evaluation
- [ ] Implementing symbolic simplification
- [ ] Implementing equation solving

### Numerical Computation
- [ ] Implementing linear system solving
- [ ] Implementing polynomial root finding
- [ ] Implementing function minimization/maximization

### Lua Scripting
- [ ] Implementing Lua environment setup
- [ ] Implementing calculator function bindings
- [ ] Implementing script execution and file loading

## Next Steps

1. Complete the implementation of basic arithmetic operations
2. Implement variable management
3. Implement command-line interface
4. Implement expression parsing and evaluation
5. Implement symbolic simplification
6. Implement equation solving
7. Implement linear system solving
8. Implement polynomial root finding
9. Implement function minimization/maximization
10. Implement Lua environment setup and function bindings

## Known Issues

- Lua headers are not available, so the LuaEngine implementation is incomplete
- GTest headers are not available, so the tests cannot be compiled
- The calculator implementation is currently a stub and only handles very simple cases

## Dependencies

- CMake 3.15+
- C++17 compatible compiler
- Lua 5.4+ (not yet integrated)
- GTest (not yet integrated)

## Notes

The current implementation is focused on establishing the basic structure and interfaces of the RebelCALC components. The actual functionality is still in the early stages of development.

The next phase will focus on implementing the core calculator functionality and symbolic mathematics capabilities.
