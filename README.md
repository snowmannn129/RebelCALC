# RebelCALC

## Advanced Computational Engine for RebelSUITE

RebelCALC is a next-generation computational engine and calculator, developed as a standalone yet integrable component of RebelSUITE. Designed to handle complex engineering, CAD, and simulation-based calculations, RebelCALC powers advanced workflows in RebelCAD, RebelENGINE, RebelSIM, and beyond.

## Core Features

- **Advanced Computation** - Symbolic algebra, numerical solvers, and real-time graphing
- **Engineering & Scientific Functions** - CAD-specific calculations, physics engine support, statistical analysis
- **Graphing & Visualization** - 2D/3D function plotting, CAD & simulation visualization
- **Lua Scripting** - Automate calculations, define reusable formulas, and process large datasets
- **Custom ANSI-Inspired UI** - Fully themeable interface with keyboard-first navigation
- **Modular Integration** - Seamlessly integrates with other RebelSUITE components

## Development Status

RebelCALC is currently in early development. See the [Development Roadmap](docs/development_roadmap.md) for more information on the current status and planned features.
