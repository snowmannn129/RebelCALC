## Current Status

RebelCALC has completed Phase 1 and Phase 2, and is now in Phase 3, focusing on enhancing the user interface with interactive elements. The core calculator functionality, symbolic mathematics, numerical computation, Lua scripting, and UI enhancements have been implemented. Advanced mathematics, engineering modules, graphing and visualization, and RebelSUITE integration have also been completed. The next steps are to complete the REPL interface for interactive calculations and create a GUI for easier access to the various modules and functions.
